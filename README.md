# OpenNumEM
Open source numerical electromagnetics using BEM-FEM and integro-differential formulations. In this personal repository I will try to develop an electromagnetic solver that is open source and hopefully it can grow in time in an open, collaborative environment. Years of experience and a deep personal interest took me here!

# Template idea
The idea of this repo is to start somewhere, so the first Â¨stone" is to open the public repo, this will hopefully force me to write down the ideas that I have been structuring for a long time!
