# OpenNumEM
Open source numerical electromagnetics using BEM-FEM and integro-differential formulations. In this personal repository I will try to develop an electromagnetic solver that is open source and hopefully it can grow in time in an open, collaborative environment. Years of experience and a deep personal interest took me here!
